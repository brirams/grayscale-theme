Grayscale Jekyll theme(bramos edition)
======================================

A [fork](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/grayscale-theme) of a jekyll implementation of a bootstrap
theme that I liked. I could've probably just copy-pasta'd my way into this instead of forking but
there were some javascript things that I wanted to rip out so this is where I ended up.

You can see the final product at brirams.github.io
